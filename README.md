# JDBC
Java JDBC - Employee List

##Usage
Compile and run the Java application. It will connect to the database and retrieve employee data.
The application will list all employees in the "employee" table and employees whose names begin with 'S'.
The results will be displayed on the console.

###Code Explanation
The application uses the JDBC API to establish a connection to the MySQL database.
Two SQL queries are defined to retrieve employee data. One lists all employees, and the other lists employees whose names start with 'S'.
The Statement and ResultSet objects are used to execute and process the SQL queries.


####Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure that your MySQL server is running, and the database connection settings are correctly configured.
